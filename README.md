This is machine learning based program that predicts prices of stocks.

It interfaces with yahoo finance and pull data from their stocks database. It then fits a random forest trees model on certain features of the particular stock in question to construct a model. Once the model is complete, users can query the application and ask for the price of any particular stock at any time in the future.

The plan is to develop this app into one that would have the potential to make money by predicting stock prices. Its success would be determined by its ability to beat the market.
